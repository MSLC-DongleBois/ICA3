ICA3 - OpenCV

For thought:

Each float array is of length 100

Depending on how we set the default FPS for the capture rate...

Presuming we have it set to 120 fps using func setFPS(desiredFrameRate)

120 fps / 100 points (frames)

1.2 arrays of data being filled per second

Also, 1000 ms / 120 frames yields 8 1/3 ms of time required per frame

Therefore, 100 points in the array (frames) * 8 1/3 ms per frame

==

approx 833 ms of data per array of length 100 given the camera sampling at an FPS of 120
